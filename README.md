Year 1 Continuous Assessment project: Web Development

📋 Overview

This repository contains the successful submission(s) for Year 1 Continuous Assessment(s) in your Web Development course. It consists primarily of HTML files representing individual assignments. These include:

UCD.html — one of the assessment pieces

mykhailohnylytskyi.html — another assessment piece

All work is implemented using pure HTML (no external CSS/JS frameworks).

🛠 What’s Inside
File	Description
UCD.html	Web page project for the UCD assignment (details to be added)
mykhailohnylytskyi.html	Another web page submission, likely with its own layout/content
📌 Usage

These pages can be viewed in any modern web browser. To view:

Clone or download the repository.

Open the .html file you want to inspect (e.g. UCD.html) in your browser.

✅ Next Steps & Ideas

To polish this project further, you might consider:

Adding CSS styling to improve layout, colors, typography.

Introducing responsive design so pages adapt to mobile screens.

Adding comments in the HTML to clarify structure or sections.

Including images, navigation links, or interactive elements (if allowed).

Writing a more detailed description here in this README for each file: purpose, learning outcomes.

⚠️ Notes

No scripts or stylesheets are currently included.

Everything is static HTML.

The repository has minimal structure at present; as you add more assessments, you may want to organize them into subfolders (e.g. assessment1/, assessment2/) for clarity.
