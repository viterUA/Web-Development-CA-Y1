> Year 1 Continuous Assessment project: Web Development

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the successful submission(s) for Year 1 Continuous Assessment(s) in your Web Development course. It consists primarily of HTML files representing individual assignments. These include:

* `UCD.html` — one of the assessment pieces
* `mykhailohnylytskyi.html` — another assessment piece

All work is implemented using **pure HTML** (no external CSS/JS frameworks).

## ✅ Next Steps & Ideas

To polish this project further, you might consider:

* Adding **CSS styling** to improve layout, colors, typography.
* Introducing **responsive design** so pages adapt to mobile screens.
* Adding comments in the HTML to clarify structure or sections.
* Including images, navigation links, or interactive elements (if allowed).
* Writing a more detailed description here in this README for each file: purpose, learning outcomes.

## ⚠️ Notes

* No scripts or stylesheets are currently included.
* Everything is static HTML.
* The repository has minimal structure at present; as you add more assessments, you may want to organize them into subfolders (e.g. `assessment1/`, `assessment2/`) for clarity.
